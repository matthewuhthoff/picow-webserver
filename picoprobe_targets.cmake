# Without any configuration, CMake attempts to find openocd on your
# system. That usually works if it is installed at a standard
# location.

# Otherwise, you can pass in the path for openocd, either with
#	-DOPENOCD_PATH=/path/to/openocd
# in the cmake invocation, or with the path in the OPENOCD_PATH
# environment variable.
